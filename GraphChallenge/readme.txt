This folder contains the two Graph Challenges code, Intellij IDEA project and maven project.

For maven, I used the Intellij IDEA support and for command line I used version 3.3.9.

There is no main for this methods, just a collection of unit test.
	
To build and run test from command line use Maven commands:

- mvn compile
- mvn test

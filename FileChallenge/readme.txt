This folder contains the Word Counter File Challenge code and Intellij IDEA project. The Intellij project has 
been configured to build to folder out.

There are two helper batch files located in this folder to build and run the project from the command line. 
They create the same output as the Intellij project. 
	
Batch files: build.cmd and run.cmd.

Included is one example text file called input.txt.

This Scala application will prompt for a filename, if run from project root folder no path is needed for input.txt
